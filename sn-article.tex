Introduction

\section{Brief introduction to Rust}

This section briefly introduces the Rust language,
focusing on the subset of interest for the purposes of this discussion.
It is meant for people familiar with PL theory but not Rust in particular.

\subsection{Notation}

We use an overline $\overline{S}$ to indicate zero or more instances of the symbol $S$.
Syntactically it is represented as a comma-separated list (with optional trailing comma).

We reference the following terminals (also called tokens):

\begin{itemize}
    \item a struct name $S$
    \item a trait name $T$
    \item an associated type name $A$
    \item a type parameter $X$
\end{itemize}

In the sections that follow we define the following non-terminals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A type name $\tau$
    \item A trait definition and Implementations
    \item A where clause $W$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types}

A type $\tau$ is...

\begin{itemize}
    \item a struct $S\langle\overline{\tau}\rangle$ with type parameters $\overline{\tau}$
    \item a tuple $(\overline{\tau})$ of types (with the empty tuple $()$ representing the unit type)
    \item an associated type $A\:\tau$
    \item a type parameter $X$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trait definitions and impls in Rust}

In Rust, a \emph{trait} $T$ is an interface, declared like so:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
trait $T$: $\overline{T_s}$ {
    type $A$: $\overline{T_b}$;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Traits in Rust contain methods and other kinds of members,
but we limit ourselves to the case of exactly one associated type.
The trait definition includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The trait name $T$
    \item A list of ``supertraits'' $\overline{T_s}$. Every type that implements $T$ must also implement $\overline{T_s}$.
    \item An associated type $A$. Every impl of $T$ must prove a value $\tau_A$ for $A$.
    \item A list of bounds $\overline{T_b}$ on $A$. The value $\tau_A$ provided for $A$ must satisfy the bounds $\overline{T_b}$.
\end{itemize}

Traits are \emph{implemented} for a given type $\tau$ via a \code{impl}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, mathescape=true]
impl<$\overline{X}$> $T$ for $\tau$ where $\overline{W}$ {
    type $A$ = $\tau_A$;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Implementations in Rust include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A set of type parameters 
\end{itemize}
    
\subsection{Where Clauses}

A provable predicate in our system is a \emph{where clause} $W$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \code{t: T} indicates that $\tau$ implements the trait $T$.
    \item \code{t: T<A = t1>} indicates that $\tau$ implements the trait $T$ and that the associated type $A$ is equal to $\tau_1$.
    \item \code{for<X...> W} indicates that $W$ is provable for all values of $overline{X}$.
    \item \code{W0 => W1}, not available in Rust today, indicates that $W_0$ being true implies $W_1$ holds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Special traits}

The most common use for traits in Rust is to define interfaces,
but they are also regularly as markers to indicate sets of types with a particular property.
Some traits are special in that they have a specific meaning to the Rust compiler,
such as the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \code{Copy} trait indicates types whose values can safely be copied by simply copying their bits.
    In logical terms, a value is not affine if its type implements \code{Copy}.
    The \code{Copy} type is implemented like any other trait but, as a special rule,
    the compiler enforces that this is only permitted if all subfields also implement \code{Copy}.
    \item The \code{Send} and \code{Sync} traits indicates types whose values can safely be sent between threads
    and shared between threads, respectively. 
    The next section discusses how they are implemented.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coinductive auto traits}

The \code{Send} and \code{Sync} traits introduced in the previous section
are the most prominent examples of \emph{auto traits}.
Auto traits are a particular set of traits (not user extensible)
for which the compiler automatically adds an implementation.
In other words, the compiler automatically decides if a type $\tau$ implements \code{Send}
(unless the user opts out by proving their own impl).
The criteria used is that $\tau$ is \code{Send} if all of its field types are \code{Send}.
The following listing shows a struct $S$ along with the impl that the compiler would automatically introduce:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
struct S<$\overline{X}$> {
    field0: $\tau_0$,
    ...
    fieldN: $\tau_N$,
}

impl<$\overline{X}$> Send for $S\langle \overline{X} \rangle$
where
    $\tau_0$: Send,
    ...
    $\tau_N$: Send,
{
    // 
}
\end{lstlisting}

Besides having an automatic implementation, auto traits are different from other traits in that they use coinductive semantics.
The need for this arises because of the possibility of cycles between types.
To see this, consider the following (recursive) struct \code{List}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
struct List {
    next: Option<Box<List>>,
    //    ^^^^^^ This is a Rust enum, which we have not included in our
    //           Rust subset, but which are a typical algebraic Data
    //           type (structs can be considered an enum with one
    //           variant).
}    
\end{lstlisting}

In this case,

\begin{itemize}
    \item \code{List} is \code{Send} if \code{Option<Box<List>>} is \code{Send},
    \item \code{Option<Box<List>>} is \code{Send} if \code{Box<List>} is \code{Send},
    \item \code{Box<List>} is \code{Send} if \code{List} is \code{Send},
    \item \code{List} is \code{Send} because we have a cycle and \code{Send} is a coinductive trait.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example programs}

Here are some example programs we'll use later on.

\subsubsection{Hello World}

\subsubsection{MagicCopy}

\subsubsection{MagicCopy}

Rust where clauses correspond to logical
Rust's syntax can be translated into our mathematical where-clauses as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \code{t: T} becomes $T\:\tau$
    \item \code{t: T<A = t1>} becomes $T\:\tau, A\:\tau \mapsto \tau_1$
    \item \code{for<X..> W} becomes $\forall\overline{X}. [\![ W ]\!]$
    \item \code{W0 => W1}, not available in Rust today, becomes $[\![ W_0 ]\!] \Rightarrow [\![ W_1 ]\!]$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Judgments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Gamma \vdash T \: \tau$ (the trait $T$ is implemented for $\tau$)
    \item $\Gamma \vdash A \: \tau \mapsto \tau_1$ (the associated type $A$, applied to the type $\tau$ reduces to $\tau_1$)
\end{itemize}

        W \in \Gamma
