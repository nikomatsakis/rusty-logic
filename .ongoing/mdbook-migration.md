# mdBook Migration Progress

## Status: In Progress

Converting LaTeX academic paper content to mdBook format with MathJax/KaTeX support.

## Progress Summary

### Completed
- ✅ Set up mdbook-katex preprocessor configuration in book.toml
- ✅ Added smart tool installation to justfile (installs only if missing)
- ✅ Updated SUMMARY.md with complete chapter structure mirroring LaTeX
- ✅ Ported Introduction chapter with factual, neutral tone
- ✅ Verified mdbook build and serve functionality
- ✅ Ported Notation chapter with math symbols and cross-references
- ✅ Verified KaTeX math rendering works correctly ($\overline{S}$, $\tau$, etc.)
- ✅ Added cross-reference links from Notation to other chapters
- ✅ Ported Types chapter with complex math notation (angle brackets, overlines, spacing)
- ✅ Ported Traits and impls chapter with mixed code/math content
- ✅ Established notation convention: overlines in math text, X_0,...,X_n in code blocks
- ✅ Verified mdbook-katex doesn't process math in code blocks (works as expected)
- ✅ Added formal code block conventions to Notation chapter
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with mdBook authoring guidelines (tone, cross-refs, notation)
- ✅ Ported Where Clauses chapter with inline code and math notation
- ✅ Ported Special traits chapter with Copy, Send, and Sync explanations
- ✅ Ported Coinductive auto traits chapter with automatic impls and cyclic types
- ✅ Ported Example programs chapter (incomplete/WIP in original LaTeX)
- ✅ Ported Judgments chapter with formal logical notation
- ✅ Ported Basic axioms chapter with inference rules using KaTeX fractions
- ✅ Ported Conclusion chapter (template content from LaTeX)
- ✅ Ported Appendix chapter with acknowledgements section

### Current Work
- **MIGRATION COMPLETE!** All LaTeX content successfully ported to mdBook

### Final Status
**All 12 chapters completed:**
1. ✅ Introduction - factual tone for PL researchers
2. ✅ Notation - with code block conventions and cross-references  
3. ✅ Types - mathematical type notation
4. ✅ Trait definitions and impls - mixed code/math with dual notation
5. ✅ Where Clauses - inline code and math symbols
6. ✅ Special traits - Copy, Send, Sync explanations
7. ✅ Coinductive auto traits - automatic impls and cyclic types
8. ✅ Example programs - incomplete/WIP from original LaTeX
9. ✅ Judgments - formal notation with concrete examples
10. ✅ Basic axioms - inference rules with structured presentation
11. ✅ Conclusion - template content
12. ✅ Appendix - acknowledgements and supplementary sections

### Achievements
- ✅ Established dual notation system (math vs code blocks)
- ✅ All mathematical notation renders correctly in KaTeX
- ✅ Cross-references between chapters implemented
- ✅ Formal inference rules converted from mathpartir to KaTeX fractions
- ✅ Code block conventions documented and applied consistently
- ✅ Stylistic guidelines established in CLAUDE.md
3. Remove LaTeX dependencies from build process once migration complete

## Technical Notes

### Tools Setup
- mdbook-katex configured for math rendering with $ and $$ delimiters
- justfile includes `just setup` and `just check` commands
- No permission issues with tool installation

### Content Guidelines
- Maintain factual, neutral tone without unnecessary adjectives
- Target audience: PL researchers familiar with type theory but not Rust
- Focus on accessibility to academic audience
