# mdBook Migration Progress

## Status: In Progress

Converting LaTeX academic paper content to mdBook format with MathJax/KaTeX support.

## Progress Summary

### Completed
- ✅ Set up mdbook-katex preprocessor configuration in book.toml
- ✅ Added smart tool installation to justfile (installs only if missing)
- ✅ Updated SUMMARY.md with complete chapter structure mirroring LaTeX
- ✅ Ported Introduction chapter with factual, neutral tone
- ✅ Verified mdbook build and serve functionality

### Current Work
- Working chapter-by-chapter to port LaTeX content to Markdown
- Testing math rendering as we go

### Next Steps
1. Port next chapter (likely Notation to test math rendering)
2. Continue chapter-by-chapter migration
3. Remove LaTeX dependencies from build process once migration complete

## Technical Notes

### Tools Setup
- mdbook-katex configured for math rendering with $ and $$ delimiters
- justfile includes `just setup` and `just check` commands
- No permission issues with tool installation

### Content Guidelines
- Maintain factual, neutral tone without unnecessary adjectives
- Target audience: PL researchers familiar with type theory but not Rust
- Focus on accessibility to academic audience
