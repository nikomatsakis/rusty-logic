Rust where clauses correspond to logical
Rust's syntax can be translated into our mathematical where-clauses as follows:

- `t: T` becomes $T\:\tau$
- `t: T<A = t1>` becomes $T\:\tau, A\:\tau \mapsto \tau_1$
- `for<X..> W` becomes $\forall\overline{X}. [\![ W ]\!]$
- `W0 => W1`, not available in Rust today, becomes $[\![ W_0 ]\!] \Rightarrow [\![ W_1 ]\!]$.
